   Hi, I am Melody!

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
  I am currently a first-year Master's student studying Information Science at the University of Michigan, specializing in User Experience Research and Design. As a multidisciplinary UX designer with a unique background in psychology and programming, I design with both empathy to users, as well as conceptual back-end knowledge of the products.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
  I leverage my professional skills at School of Information through a wide range of graduate courses. For instance, I learned UX research, interaction design, graphic design, agile project management and programming during my first year. I believe interdisciplinary learning enables a UX designer to solve problems with multiple perspectives, thus creating better products with creativity and innovation.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Although I would not call myself an artist, I do have a life-long passion for art, whether appreciating or creating. I painted during high school, making artwork ranging from sketches to watercolor or even oil paintings. (If you would like to see those works, please donâ€™t hesitate to scroll down!) Currently, I focus on digital design, such as graphic design and user interface design. Regardless of what the media is, I enjoy and value aesthetic visual design while creating products with UX methodologies.</p>
